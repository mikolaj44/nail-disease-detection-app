# Aplikacja do wczesnego wykrywania chorób płytki paznokcia

Stworzona w ramach koła naukowego "Praktyka"

# TODO (randomly-ish ordered):

Buttons in main menu need to be scaled properly to fit

The navigation bar needs to be refactored (list of classes and taking an integer index as a parameter to switch), slide animations are needed, right now it just jumps weirdly

An indicator for the currently active page on the navigation bar would probably be useful

Add the translations (easy_localization)

Fix the focus problem on camera view

Add image cropping

Add image from phone gallery support

Find the right brightness value

Add the image-taking tutorial page

The button on the introduction page has a weird graphical bug

# DONE (since last meeting)

Settings menu (design and functionality)
