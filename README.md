# App designed for preliminary detection of nail diseases

Created as part of the "Practice" student research group

## Used technologies and AI models:
- Flutter
- YOLOv8 Nano model

## What still needs to be done (randomly-ish ordered):

Image cropping and calculating the brightness for the cropped image, not the full one as it is right now

Make analysis of images from gallery faster

Experiment with a different model (maybe yolo v11n and a bigger dataset, like 10000 images)

## What has been done (since our last meeting)

Settings menu (design and functionality)

Full English translation

Refactored the navigation bar, it now also shows which page is active. The slide animation still needs to be added

Added proper main menu scaling

Fixed centering and the button graphical bug on introduction page

Adjusted the brightness value

Removed the camera switch button (for now)

Simple camera tutorial page, tutorial/introduction pages now get shown only if the user hasn't seen them before
