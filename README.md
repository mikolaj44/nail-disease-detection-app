# App designed for preliminary detection of nail diseases

Created as part of the "Practice" student research group

## Used technologies and AI models:
- Flutter
- YOLOv8 Nano model

## What still needs to be done (randomly-ish ordered):

Fix the focus problem on camera view

Add image cropping

Add image from phone gallery support

Find the right brightness value

Add the image-taking tutorial page

The button on the introduction page has a weird graphical bug on mobile that's not visible on the web

## What has been done (since our last meeting)

Settings menu (design and functionality)

English translation

Refactored the navigation bar, it also shows which page is active. The slide animation still needs to be added

Added proper main menu scaling
