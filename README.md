# App designed for preliminary detection of nail diseases

Created as part of the "Practice" student research group

## Used technologies and AI models:
- Flutter
- YOLOv8 Nano model

## What still needs to be done (randomly-ish ordered):

Buttons in main menu need to be scaled properly to fit

The navigation bar needs to be refactored (list of classes and taking an integer index as a parameter to switch), slide animations are needed

An indicator for the currently active page on the navigation bar would be useful

Fix the focus problem on camera view

Add image cropping

Add image from phone gallery support

Find the right brightness value

Add the image-taking tutorial page

The button on the introduction page has a weird graphical bug on mobile that's not visible on the web

## What has been done (since our last meeting)

Settings menu (design and functionality)

English translation
